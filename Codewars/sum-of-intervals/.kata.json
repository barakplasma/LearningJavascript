  "description": "Write a function called `sumIntervals`/`sum_intervals()` that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.\n\n#### Intervals\n\nIntervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array.  The first value of the interval will always be less than  the second value. Interval example:  `[1, 5]` is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.\n\n#### Overlapping Intervals\n\nList containing overlapping intervals:<br/>\n\n```\n[\n   [1,4],\n   [7, 10],\n   [3, 5]\n]\n```\n\nThe sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1,2],\n   [6, 10],\n   [11, 15]\n] ); // => 9\n\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1,4],\n   [7, 10],\n   [3, 5]\n] ); // => 7\n\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1,5],\n   [10, 20],\n   [1, 6],\n   [16, 19],\n   [5, 11]\n] ); // => 19\n```",
